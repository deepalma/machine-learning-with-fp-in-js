# Machine Learning with Functional Programming JavaScript 

In this repo I'm refactoring the code from this (amazing) [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-with-javascript-part-1-9b97f3ed4fe5) using a functional programming style.

This is to be intended as a personal playground where I want to try experimenting mainly with [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) and [Ramda-Fantasy](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy).
The original blog post is used to avoid having to come up with an idea of my own :)

The original source code from Abhishek Soni (the author of the blog post) can be found [here](https://github.com/abhisheksoni27/machine-learning-with-js)

Suggestions on how to improve my version are very very welcome.
